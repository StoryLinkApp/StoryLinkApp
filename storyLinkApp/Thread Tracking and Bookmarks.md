# Thread Tracking and Bookmarks: 

- The ability for users to track their progress and bookmark specific points within story threads is important for a seamless user experience. 

- Users can easily pick up where they left off and continue following their favorite threads without having to search or navigate through the timeline. 

- This feature allows users to maintain their engagement and easily resume their reading journey.

## Example Scenario:

- __One evening,__ they start reading the "Time Traveler's Odyssey" thread, an epic adventure through different historical eras.

- After reading through several chapters, __User1 needs to pause their reading session.__ 

- They don't want to lose their progress and wish to continue from where they left off the next day. 

- With __Thread Tracking and Bookmarks, User1 can easily mark their current position in the "Time Traveler's Odyssey" thread.__

- User1 __clicks on the bookmark icon within the thread or a designated "Add Bookmark" button in the user interface.__ 

- The app then saves their progress and creates a bookmark at the last read chapter or specific page number. 

- The next time User1 accesses the "Time Traveler's Odyssey" thread, they can simply click on the bookmark to instantly continue their reading journey from that exact point, without having to remember or search for their last position.

- But that's not all. __User1 is an avid reader and follows multiple threads on the platform.__ They often switch between stories to keep their reading experience diverse and engaging.

-  With Thread Tracking, __User1's reading progress is saved across all the threads they explore.__

- They can effortlessly switch between threads and continue reading from where they left off in each one.

- For instance, User1 might be reading a thrilling crime-solving thread called "The Detective Chronicles." 

- They read several chapters __but decide to switch to the fantasy thread "Legends of the Dragon Realms" for a change.__

- They click on the bookmark in "The Detective Chronicles" before moving to the other thread. 

- The __bookmark saves their progress in "The Detective Chronicles,"__ allowing them to come back to the story and pick up the mystery right where they left it.

### In this example:
